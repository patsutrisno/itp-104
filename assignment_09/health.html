        <h1><span class="sec">✚ Health Effects</span> of Drinking Matcha</h1>
        <p>
            Matcha tastes great, but just because something tastes great doesn't mean you should be drinking it all the time - I'm looking
            at you Pepsi 👀 so it's crazy so me how something as tasty as Matcha actually has incredible health benefits too. It's so great 
            that even if it didn't taste good, I would still drink for the positive health effects 💚 Enough said, here are some 
            <span class="prim">vital nutrients</span> that matcha provides.
        </p>

            <div class="right-col">
                <p>
                    1. <span class="prim">Rich in Antioxidants:</span> Matcha is high in catechins, a type of antioxidant, which helps in reducing cell 
                    damage and preventing chronic diseases. Who doesn't love a slower aging process 🤩
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. <span class="prim">Enhances Brain Function:</span> Matcha contains caffeine and L-theanine, which can improve various aspects of brain function, 
                    like attention, reaction time, and memory 🧠
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. <span class="prim">Weight Loss:</span> Green tea extract is popular in weight loss supplements due to its potential to boost metabolism and increase fat burning.
                    Great tasting and fat burning? I find this an absolute win 💃
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. <span class="prim">Improves Skin Health:</span> The antioxidants in matcha can also benefit the skin by reducing inflammation and 
                    redness, and improving its overall health. 🧴
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. <span class="prim">Heart Health:</span> Some studies suggest that green tea, including matcha, can help reduce levels of total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, 
                    as well as triglycerides. It may also help prevent the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, another factor that may protect against heart disease. ❤️
